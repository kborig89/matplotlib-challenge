# Matplotlib Drug Performance in mice

In this data set, 249 mice i were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

The data set is visualized using jupyter notebook and matplotlib.

## Visualizations

* A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

* A bar plot using both Pandas's and Matplotlib's that shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

* A pie plot using both Pandas's and Matplotlib's that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* The final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. The quartiles and IQR and quantitatively are calculated to determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

* A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.

* A line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse.

* A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.



To run and view visualizations run in the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb jupyter notebook.
